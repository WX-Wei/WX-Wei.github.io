I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, working on audio intelligence, Music Information Retrieval (MIR), and multimodal music understanding. My research aims to bridge symbolic, auditory, and textual representations of music through deep learning, with a focus on building generalizable models that support cross-modal alignment, automatic music transcription, structure analysis, and semantic understanding.

Before joining Kyoto University, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Fudan University, where I specialized in intelligent media computing, and my B.S. from Zhejiang University. I have also worked as a research intern at ByteDance AI Lab and iFLYTEK Research, contributing to large-scale music classification, multimodal representation learning, and real-time speech recognition systems.

My recent work explores efficient Transformer architectures, sparse attention mechanisms, optimal-transport-based sequence alignment, and multimodal pretraining for music understanding. I have authored papers accepted to ISMIR, ICME, APSIPA, and Springer LNEE, with ongoing submissions to ICASSP and IEEE/ACM TASLP. I also maintain open-source software, including [HarmoF0](https://github.com/WX-Wei/HarmoF0), a pitch estimation toolkit with 100+ GitHub stars.

Broadly, I am interested in advancing machine listening and computational music understanding toward more robust, interpretable, and musically aware AI systems.
